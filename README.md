# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Traditional programming has to do with writing out scripts/code on a computer or testing new codes whereas software engineering is involved in developing a new software, testing it out and sometimes coding on the software to test if it works.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
This is the process or steps that are followed to produce a functional and high-quality software in a short period time. The steps include:
Planning phase: During this phase, information is collected from the users on the type of software needed and what requirements the software should meet. 
Designing phase: During this phase, the software engineers analyse the requirements stipulated in the planning phase and identify the best way to create the software.  Other information required is the resources required to build the software, cost of the resources and where to get those resources. One last point to put into consideration is how to integrate the software into the existing IT structure
Implementation phase: the development team codes the product by analysing the requirements
Testing phase: Test the software that was developed for defects and if it meets the requirements of the original specifications. For example, coding on the software and checking if it works.
Deployment: In this phase, the product Is released to the users. In this phase, the software engineers still monitor the program for overall system performance.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile	Waterfall model:
Flexible timeline
Include users/clients in project development
Budget for the project development is fixed since methodology is fixed
Preferred in project that still needs to be researched and tested.

Whereas Waterfall models:
Have Fixed timeline
Does not involve client in project development
Budget for the project development is not fixed because of the flexibility of the project.
Preferred in projects that have a defined end goal and those that are properly planned with clear vision.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of developing and verifying the requirements of the system. The process of system engineering includes requirements formulation, validation and verification. Requirements engineering plays a vital role in SDLC by assisting software engineers to understand the needs of the clients or users(https://typeset.io/pdf/tailoring-effective-requirement-s-specification-for-3mbb6hikya.pdf).

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design means to have or design a system that is made up of individual parts that are independent of each other. Modularity improves the maintainability and scalability of the software systems because the systems can be reused in different products without modification. The ability of the system to be re-used will shorten the period required to develop, test and maintain a new system


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing:Tesing of small individual components of the software application.
Integration testing: This involve putting together small individual componets of the system together and testing them.
System Testing:Involve testing a completely build system to check if it working
Acceptance testing:Involve testing a completely build system to check if it meets the specified requirements of the client.

Testing is crucial in software development to ensure that the software sytem is working and that it meets the requirements of the client (https://www.computer.org/resources/importance-of-software-testing).


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control sytems are tools that assists software enginners to track and manage changes in the software development life cycle. Example of Version control system is Git. Features of GIt that are version control sytem are track history, creates back-ups, free and open source(https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-git).

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Role: manage the software development projects. This include the planning, executing and closing of the projects.

Responsibilities: Plan and schedule projects, manage the development team, mitigate any risks encountered, manage the budget, communicate with both clientsfor updates and the development team for progress and paperwork invloved in project closing.

Chanllenges:Delivering the product on the timeline agreed upon regardless of the delays, Keeping the team motivated and united, managing conflict of interest between development team and the clients, and keeping the project on the budget set.


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenace: process of updating and modifying the software to meet clients requirements.

Types:
Corrective Software Maintenance- involves maintaining the system when there is faults encountered when running the system.
Preventative Software Maintenance -This involves maintaining the system before any faults could occur.Example is sytem upggrades.
Perfective Software Maintenance-Involve adding new features or removing unused features on the system to allow it to work better.
Adaptive Software Maintenance-has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software (https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/software-monetization/four-types-of-software-maintenance#:~:text=Software%20maintenance%20is%20the%20process,to%20boost%20performance%2C%20and%20more.)

Why maintenace is important:to ensure that software is efficient, secure and reliable. 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
 Ethicaal issues: Data integrity, Conflict of interest and compliance.

 How to adhere to ethical standards- Communicating about the ethical standards, and promoting them at the workplace can assist them to adhere to the standards
